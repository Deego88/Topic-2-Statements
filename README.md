This is a program to calculate a persons BMI 
We need to collect two forms of input form the user to make teh BMI calculation:
1- weight in kg
2- height in cm
both are floating point numbers.
we convert the cm input to m and raise to the power of 2, this gives us m2.
the output is then printed with string text and BMI result.
